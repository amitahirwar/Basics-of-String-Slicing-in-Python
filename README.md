# Python String Manipulation Exercises

Welcome to the Python String Manipulation Exercises repository! This collection aims to provide a comprehensive set of exercises covering a range of fundamental concepts related to string manipulation in Python. These exercises are designed to help you build a solid foundation in working with strings and enhance your overall proficiency in Python programming.

## Exercises Overview:

1. **Print First and Last Characters:**
   - Declare a string and print the first character.
   - Print the last character of the string.

2. **Extract Substring:**
   - Declare a string and extract a substring containing the first three characters.
   - Extract a substring that starts from the third character to the end of the string.

3. **Print Even and Odd Positions:**
   - Declare a string and print characters at even positions (0-based index).
   - Print characters at odd positions of the string.

4. **Reverse a String:**
   - Declare a string and print it in reverse order.

5. **Slice with Stride:**
   - Declare a string and print every second character using slicing.

6. **Negative Indexing:**
   - Declare a string and use negative indexing to print the last three characters.

7. **Substring Replacement:**
   - Declare a string and replace a specific substring with another.

8. **Slice from the End:**
   - Declare a string and extract the last four characters using slicing.

9. **Omitting Start or End Index:**
   - Declare a string and print the first three characters without specifying the start index.
   - Print the last four characters without specifying the end index.

10. **Slice with Variables:**
    - Declare a string and use variables to dynamically define start and end indices for slicing.

11. **Empty String Slicing:**
    - Declare an empty string and attempt to perform string slicing. Observe the result.

12. **String Functions:**
    - Declare a string and explore various functions such as finding length, converting case, counting occurrences, concatenation, repetition, finding substrings, replacing, stripping whitespaces, splitting, and joining strings.

13. **Checking Start and End:**
    - Declare a string and check if it starts with a specific prefix.
    - Check if the same string ends with a specific suffix.

14. **Character Isolation:**
    - Declare a string and use indexing to isolate and print the third character.

15. **String Formatting:**
    - Declare variables for a person's name and age, and use string formatting to create a sentence.
